# civil-protection-symbols-esri

Esri style files for ArcMap 10x for the civil protection symbols designed by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, working in partnership with Ministry of Defence and Ordnance Survey.

The style files use the PNG versions, with appropriate offset so that arrows point to the point feature. See https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/contact-us/mapping-for-emergencies
